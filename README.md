# RPI-WS2812-Server
This is a small program for driving the WS281x (a.k.a. [NeoPixel](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12999)) LEDs from a webserver, command line, text file, Python,... using the Raspberry Pi. It uses the rpi_ws281x PWM driver code from jgarff ([https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x](https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x)). The LEDs can be controlled by sending text commands to a tcp socket. These commands can be generated by a webserver script, android app,... It's also possible to control the leds directly from the command line or by loading text file containing some predefined color patterns.
Since version 5.0 support for the SK9822 chips which use a clock and data (SPI like interface) was added.

read the change log to see what is new:
[CHANGES.md](https://github.com/tom-2015/rpi-ws2812-server/blob/master/CHANGES.md)

# Supported chips
You can use this with the WS2811, WS2812, SK6812, SK9822 chips.

# Installation
On the raspberry you open a terminal window and type following commands:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gcc make git libjpeg-dev libpng-dev
git clone https://github.com/tom-2015/rpi-ws2812-server.git
cd rpi-ws2812-server
make
sudo chmod +x ws2812svr
```

Newer versions require libjpeg-dev and libpng-dev for reading PNG and JPEG images.
If you don't want to use JPEG or PNG you can disable this using:
```
make NO_JPEG=1 NO_PNG=1
```

On newer Raspbian (>=Jessie) operating system the audio output is activated by default, you need to disable this:
You can do this by blacklisting the sound module:
```
echo "blacklist snd_bcm2835" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/snd-blacklist.conf
```

Also in comment out the `audio=on` parameter in `/boot/config.txt`
```
sed "s/^dtparam=audio=on/#dtparam=audio=on/g" /boot/config.txt
```

# Testing
Connect your LEDs to the PWM output of the Raspberry Pi and start the program:
```
sudo ./ws2812svr
```

Now first initialize the driver code from jgarff by typing 'setup'.
On the following line you must **replace 10** by the number of leds you have attached!.
```
setup 1,10
init
```

Now you can type commands to change the color of the leds.
For example make them all red:

```
fill 1,FF0000
render
```

# Available commands
Here is a list of commands you can type or send to the program. All commands have optional comma seperated parameters. The parameters must be in the correct order!

* `init` command must be called everytime the program is started after the setup command, this will initialize resource on the Pi according to the setup command

```
init <frequency>,<dma>

# <frequency> Frequency to use for communication to the LEDs, default 800000
# <dma>       DMA channel number to use, default 10 be careful not to use any channels in use by the system as this may crash your SD card/OS
#             use cat /proc/device-tree/soc/dma@7e007000/brcm,dma-channel-mask to see which channels (bitmask) might be used by the OS
```

* `setup` command must be called everytime the program is started:

Depending on the `<led_type>` the setup command takes different parameters.

```

# For <led_type> values 0-11 (WS2812 and SK6812 chips):

# <global_brightness>  Global brightness level for channel (0-255), default 255
# <gpionum>            GPIO output number, default 18 for more see 'GPIO usage' at this page: [https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x](https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x)


# For <led_type> values 12-17 (SK9822 chips):

setup <channel>,<led_count>,<led_type>,<invert>,<global_brightness>,<SPI_DEV>,<SPI_SPEED>,<ALT_SPI_PIN>

# <channel>            Channel number
# <led_count>          Number of leds in channel

* It is possible to start threads, a thread will execute commands between thread_start and thread_stop in the background.
  Multiple threads can run at the same time by changing the <index> parameter.
  <join_type> will determine the behavior next time you call thread_start with the <index> value of a thread that is still running
  if join_type is 0 the thread will be aborted immediately, value of 1 it will wait until the thread completed all commands and then READY + CRLF is returned.
```
thread_start <index>,<join_type>
	do
		rotate 1,1,2
		render
		delay 200
	loop
thread_stop
```

* `set_thread_exit_type` This will set if the thread should be aborted when the kill_thread or ini_thread command is executed for the <thread_id> parameter
						 READY + newline (CR + LF) will be returned when the thread has exited.
```
set_thread_exit_type <thread_id>,<type>

# <thread_id>   The thread number  (1-63)
# <type>        Exit type: 0 - aborts current running thread and immediate execute next commands
                           1 - wait until all commands completed, then exit
```

* `wait_thread` wait for a given thread to finish all commands (the exit type is ignored here)
```
wait_thread <thread_id>

# <thread_id>  The thread number (1-63)
```

* `kill_thread` terminate the given thread_id
```
kill_thread <thread_id>,<type>

# <thread_id>    The thread number (1-63)

```

* `wait_signal` waits for a signal from another thread before executing the next command
```
wait_signal
```


* `signal_thread` send a signal to the given thread_id to continue executing commands
```
signal_thread <thread_id>
# <thread_id>  The thread number (1-63)
```

* `reset` reset all initialized led strings, ready for new setup commands
```
reset
```

# Special keywords

You can add `do ... loop [times]` to repeat commands.

For example the commands between `do` and `loop` will be executed 10 times:
```
do
	<enter commands here to repeat>
loop 10
```

Endless loops can be made by removing the '10'.
Inside a loop you can use {i} for the loop counter as function argument where i is the loop index (for loop inside loop)

For example {0} will be automatically replace by 0,1,2,3,4:

```
do
	fill 1,FF0000,{0},1
loop 5
render
```

is the same as the C-style code:

```c
for (i=0; i<5; i++) {
	fill 1,FF0000,i,1
}
```

If you have nested loops you can increase the {0} to {1}, {2},...

```
do
	do
		fill 1,FF0000,{1},1
	loop 5
	render
loop
```

Also possible to add a step value for the loop index to fill every "even" led

```
do
	fill 1,FF0000,{0},1
loop 5,2
```

is the same as:

```
for (i=0; i<5; i+=2) {
	fill 1,FF0000,i,1
}
```

To create an alternating pattern of colors use rotate commands in a loop.
For a 300 LED string this will create alternating RED-YELLOW-GREEN-BLUE-PINK colors:
```
do
	rotate 1,1,1,FF0000
	rotate 1,1,1,FFFF00
	rotate 1,1,1,00FF00
	rotate 1,1,1,0000FF
	rotate 1,1,1,FF00FF
loop 60
```

# PHP example
First start the server program:

* `sudo ./ws2812svr -tcp`

Then run the php code from the webserver (check out the internet how to setup a webserver PHP+APACHE or PHP+NGINX on your Pi):

```PHP
// Create a rainbow for 10 leds on channel 1:

send_to_leds("setup 1,10;init;brightness 1,32;");

function send_to_leds ($data) {
	$sock = fsockopen("127.0.0.1", 9999);
	fwrite($sock, $data);
	fclose($sock);
}
```

# Command line parameters

```
# Listens for clients to connect to port 9999 (default).
sudo ./ws2812svr -tcp 9999`

# Loads commands from a text file
sudo ./ws2812svr -f text_file.txt

# Creates a device called /dev/ws281x where you can write you commands to with any other programming language (do-loop not supported here).
sudo ./ws2812svr -p /dev/ws281x

# Initializes with command setup 1,4,5 and command init it
sudo ./ws2812svr -i "setup 1,4,5; init;"

# Loads with settings from a config file
sudo ./ws2812svr -c /etc/ws2812svr.conf
```

# Running as a service
To run as service run make install after compilation and adjust the config file in /etc/ws2812svr.conf
```
make
sudo make install
```

After installing service it will run by default in TCP mode on port 9999, if you want to change this you must edit the config file:
```
sudo nano /etc/ws2812svr.conf
```

Change the mode to:
tcp for TCP mode (change the port= setting)
file for file mode (change the file= setting for location of file)
pipe for named pipe mode (change the pipe= setting for the location of the named pipe)
mode must be first setting in the conf file!
init setting can be used to initialize the led count and type fill color,...
```
mode=tcp
port=9999
file=/home/pi/test.txt
pipe=/dev/leds
init=
```

# Complex animations
If you need to create an complex animation, it is suggested to save color values (each LED 1 pixel) in a png/jpg image file and load this file with the readpng command.
If you have a LED string of 300 LEDs best is to create an image file which is 300 pixels wide and X pixels high.
